##Makers Academy Week 8 Project


###Aim

The aim of this project was to introduce the cohort to the Rails framework.

We had to build a basic blogging application, ensuring that we used TDD and followed a structured work flow.


###Other details

The task was set by Alex Peattie, [@alexpeattie](http://www.github.com/alexpeattie)

To get started, I followed [this rails tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

This app was built in Rails, but I also used JavaScript, JSON, Ajax, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS

###Features
* Implement user management features using the Devise gem
* Users have the ability to post blog posts to a main page
* Users can edit or delete their posts
* Users can comment on individual blog posts
* Users can vote up or down blog posts
* Blog posts are ordered by number of votes
* Using Ajax, vote counts are updated without a page refresh

###To do

* Refactor the code, in particular the CSS, where responsiveness of the site needs to be improved
* Improve user management features so users can only edit and delete their own posts
